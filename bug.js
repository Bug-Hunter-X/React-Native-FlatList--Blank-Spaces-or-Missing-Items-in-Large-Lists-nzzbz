This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and attempting to render a large number of items.  It manifests as blank spaces or missing items in the list, especially when scrolling quickly or when there's a lot of data to render.

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={this.state.data}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.text}</Text>}
/>
```

The issue often stems from React Native's rendering optimizations.  When the list updates rapidly, React Native might struggle to keep up, leading to incomplete rendering or dropped frames.
